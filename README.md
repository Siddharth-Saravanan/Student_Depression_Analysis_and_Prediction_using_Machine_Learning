This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student depression using machine learning techniques, supported by exploratory data analysis (EDA) of psychological, social, and academic factors. The goal is to derive insights and build a classification model that can help identify students potentially facing depression.

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

- **Univariate analysis completed:** Age, Gender, City, Academic Pressure, Sleep, CGPA, Suicidal Thoughts, Family Mental History, Work/Study Hours, Dietary Habits  
- **Bivariate analysis started:** Initial results for gender vs depression, academic pressure vs depression, financial stress vs depression, top 5 cities vs gender-depression distribution  
- **Next steps:** Remaining bivariate questions and feature correlation

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Student Depression Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset?resource=download)

### **Feature Descriptions**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier for each student record |
| Gender | Student's gender (Male/Female/Other) |
| Age | Age of the student (in years) |
| City | City or region of residence |
| Profession | Studentâ€™s field of work or study |
| Academic Pressure | Level of academic stress faced by the student |
| Work Pressure | Level of work-related stress (for employed students) |
| CGPA | Cumulative Grade Point Average (academic performance) |
| Study Satisfaction | Satisfaction level with their studies |
| Job Satisfaction | Satisfaction level with their job/work (if applicable) |
| Sleep Duration | Average daily sleep hours |
| Dietary Habits | Eating and nutrition patterns |
| Degree | Degree/program the student is pursuing |
| Suicidal Thoughts | Whether the student has experienced suicidal thoughts (Yes/No) |
| Work/Study Hours | Average hours dedicated to work/study per day |
| Financial Stress | Level of financial stress experienced |
| Family History of Mental Illness | Presence of mental illness in family history (Yes/No) |
| Depression | **Target variable** indicating depression (Yes/No) |

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Clean and explore the dataset  
- Identify key factors affecting student depression  
- Build and evaluate predictive models  
- Communicate findings visually and clearly

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights (so far)

- **Academic Pressure** and **Financial Stress** are associated with higher depression rates.  
- **Younger students (18â€“22)** show a relatively higher depression rate compared to older groups.  
- **Gender differences** in depression are minor but present (males slightly higher overall).  
- **Top 5 cities** with the highest depression rates show similar depression patterns for both genders, indicating city-level factors may play a bigger role.

## ðŸ§  Upcoming Tasks

- Complete remaining bivariate analysis (degree vs depression, sleep vs depression, etc.)  
- Correlation heatmap and feature importance analysis  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Optional deployment
