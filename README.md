This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student depression using machine learning techniques, supported by exploratory data analysis (EDA) of psychological, social, and academic factors. The goal is to derive insights and build classification models that can help identify students potentially facing depression.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **Gender vs Depression:** Slightly higher depression among males, but not significantly different.  
- **Academic Pressure vs Depression:** Higher academic pressure shows clear association with increased depression.  
- **Age + Financial Stress vs Depression:** Younger students (18â€“22) with high financial stress are more prone to depression.  
- **Age + CGPA vs Depression:** Lower CGPA in younger groups correlates with higher depression rates.  
- **Top 5 Cities + Gender vs Depression:** Depression rates are similar across top cities for both genders. 
- **Degree vs Depression:** Notable spike for Class 12 students (edge case).  
- **Suicidal Thoughts vs Depression:** Very strong correlation â€” students with suicidal thoughts show very high depression incidence.  
- **Dietary Habits vs Depression:** Unhealthy eating habits slightly associated with higher depression.  
- **Dietary Habits + Suicidal Thoughts vs Depression:** Combination of unhealthy diet and suicidal thoughts â†’ highest depression rates.
