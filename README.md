This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student depression using machine learning techniques, supported by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and psychological, social, and academic factors. The goal is to derive insights and build a classification model that can help identify students potentially facing depression.

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

> âœ… **Progress: Completed Univariate EDA up to CGPA**

Weâ€™ve completed a structured univariate analysis of the following variables:

- **Age**: Histogram + KDE + Boxplot to understand range and detect outliers  
- **Gender**: Pie chart for binary distribution  
- **City**: Top-N planning in place (multi-category)  
- **Academic Pressure**: Countplot  
- **Sleep Duration**: Pie chart with color palette and explode effect  
- **Family Mental Health History**: Countplot (`Yes`/`No` ordered)  
- **Suicidal Thoughts**: Countplot (`Yes`/`No` ordered)  
- **CGPA**: Histogram + Boxplot â€” helped identify outliers (e.g., 0 CGPA) as valid EDA insight
