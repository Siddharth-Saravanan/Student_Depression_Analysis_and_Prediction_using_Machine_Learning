This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student depression using machine learning techniques, supported by exploratory data analysis (EDA) of psychological, social, and academic factors. The goal is to derive insights and build classification models that can help identify students potentially facing depression.

## ðŸ“Š Current Progress
- âœ… **Data Cleaning**  
  - Removed irrelevant features, handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and split dataset for training/testing.  
- âœ… **EDA**  
  - Completed univariate analysis (age, gender, academic pressure, CGPA, sleep duration, suicidal thoughts, family history, dietary habits, etc.).  
  - Completed bivariate analysis (14 questions including pivot-based grouped plots, stacked bars, heatmaps, and a lollipop plot).  
- ðŸŸ¡ **Model Building**  
  - **Logistic Regression**:
    - Scikit-learn baseline implemented and evaluated.
    - Custom Logistic Regression built from scratch (gradient descent, loss, sigmoid).
    - Performance validated (ROC-AUC = **0.92**, Accuracy = **84%**, F1 = **87%**).

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights (from Bivariate Analysis)
- **Gender vs Depression:** Slightly higher depression among males, but not significantly different.  
- **Academic Pressure vs Depression:** Higher academic pressure shows clear association with increased depression.  
- **Age + Financial Stress vs Depression:** Younger students (18â€“22) with high financial stress are more prone to depression.  
- **Age + CGPA vs Depression:** Lower CGPA in younger groups correlates with higher depression rates.  
- **Top 5 Cities + Gender vs Depression:** Depression rates are similar across top cities for both genders. 
- **Degree vs Depression:** Notable spike for Class 12 students (edge case).  
- **Suicidal Thoughts vs Depression:** Very strong correlation â€” students with suicidal thoughts show very high depression incidence.  
- **Dietary Habits vs Depression:** Unhealthy eating habits slightly associated with higher depression.  
- **Dietary Habits + Suicidal Thoughts vs Depression:** Combination of unhealthy diet and suicidal thoughts â†’ highest depression rates.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Implement additional models (with scikit-learn comparison):
  1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  3. Decision Tree
  4. Random Forest
  5. Gradient Boosting
  6. Naive Bayes
  7. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  8. XGBoost
- Plot training/loss curves for models.
- Create final summary visualizations:
  - Accuracy vs Epoch (where applicable)
  - ROC-AUC comparisons
  - Final model comparison barplot (Custom vs scikit-learn)
- Deploy the best-performing model as a lightweight app or API.
